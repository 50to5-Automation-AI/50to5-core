# Fifty-to-Five üöÄ

Welcome to **Fifty-to-Five**, an ambitious project aimed at empowering small teams to operate like industry giants through cutting-edge automation and AI. Our mission is to develop tools that transform a 5-person company into a powerhouse that can compete with companies 50 times their size or more.

## Mission üåü

**Our Mission**: To build a community-driven set of tools that help small teams operate with the efficiency and impact of much larger organizations.

## Tools We Use üõ†Ô∏è

- **ClickUp**: For task management and project tracking.
- **Zapier**: For automating workflows and integrating various apps.
- **Custom Code**: Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) via llama-index and agent tools (TBC).

## How We Use LLM's:
Our workflows are orchestrated and distributed across teams through a state management service that initializes the environment and monitors performance. These metrics are collected to train an agent policy, reward, and action mechanism for Reinforcement Learning.

LLMs are utilized to address the perennial problem of interdepartmental communication and provide future recommendations based on current and historical data. Data quality and consistency remain critical in all our projects.

Today and tonight, we've been evaluating a finely tuned version of OpenAI's gpt-4o-mini. Training is ongoing using both traditional and evolving benchmarks. The performance of these models, which are orders of magnitude smaller than foundation models, is outstanding.

## Core Automatable Tasks üìù

Here are some of the core tasks we aim to automate for a software project:

1. **Project Initialization**:
   - Create a new Git repository with an appropriate folder structure.
   - List the project in Jira for task management.
   - Automatically create a new GitHub repository in the specified GitHub account.

2. **Daily Stand-ups and Reporting**:
   - Generate and distribute daily reports based on the activities of automated agents.
   - Include summaries of completed tasks, ongoing projects, and upcoming deadlines.

3. **Code Reviews and Merges**:
   - Automate code review assignments.
   - Ensure pull requests are automatically merged after successful reviews and passing tests.

4. **Issue Tracking and Management**:
   - Automatically triage incoming issues.
   - Assign issues to appropriate team members based on their workload and expertise.

5. **Deployment and Monitoring**:
   - Automate deployment processes to various environments.
   - Set up monitoring and alerting for critical application metrics.

## Universal Configuration Patterns üõ†Ô∏è

To ensure consistency and efficiency, we adopt universal configuration patterns:

1. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Use environment variables for configuration management.
   - Maintain separate configurations for development, staging, and production environments.

2. **Coding Standards**:
   - Follow industry best practices for coding standards.
   - Implement automated linters and formatters to maintain code quality.

3. **CI/CD Pipelines**:
   - Utilize continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
   - Integrate with tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or CircleCI.

## Daily Reports üìä

Our system produces daily reports based on the activities of automated agents. These reports include:

- Summary of tasks completed and pending.
- Activity logs of automated agents.
- Key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics.
- Upcoming deadlines and important milestones.
- "Weak Labelling" through the use of LLM as judge for labelling through random sample of ```N as a member of set S being the size of our live dat a analysis``` 

## Unified API üåê

To streamline integration and extend functionality, we provide a unified API:

- **Standardized Endpoints**: Consistent API endpoints for various services.
- **Authentication**: Secure API access using OAuth or API keys.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation for ease of use.
